### Introduction
Deep learning models, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have transformed image classification tasks by effectively extracting hierarchical features. However, to train these models successfully, it is crucial to monitor the process carefully to prevent overtraining and ensure good generalization. Overtraining happens when the model memorizes the training data rather than learning general patterns, resulting in poor performance on unseen data.

In this paper, i fine-tuned a pre-trained VGG16 model to classify images of cats, dogs, and snakes. The dataset was divided into training, validation, and test sets, and i evaluated the model's ability to generalize across these groups.
This study explores scenarios that lead to overtraining, techniques to mitigate it, and the performance of the model for each class. The goal is to provide recommendations for enhancing the model's effectiveness. By analyzing training metrics and classification results, this paper offers valuable insights into effective practices in deep learning.

### Problem Statement
The goal of this project is to classify images into three categories: cats, dogs, and snakes. While transfer learning with VGG16 offers a robust feature extraction mechanism, challenges such as overtraining, class imbalance, and misclassification errors must be addressed. The specific problems analyzed include:
1.	Identifying the onset of overtraining and its effects on model performance.
2.	Determining effective strategies to prevent overtraining and improve generalization.
3.	Evaluating class-specific performance to identify poorly performing classes and recommending improvements.
This paper focuses on addressing these challenges by analyzing the training process and leveraging metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to guide recommendations.

### Overtraining Scenario
Overtraining is evident in Epoch 4, where the training accuracy increased to 68.71%, but validation accuracy dropped significantly to 54.83%. Simultaneously, validation loss spiked from 0.6384 in Epoch 3 to 0.9681 in Epoch 4. This indicates that the model started to memorize patterns in the training data, compromising its ability to generalize to unseen validation samples.

### Training Methods to Prevent Overtraining
Early Stopping
Early stopping is a practical method to halt training when validation performance stagnates or worsens. In this scenario, training could have been stopped after Epoch 3, as subsequent epochs did not yield improvements in validation accuracy.
Regularization
Applying dropout regularization (e.g., 50% before fully connected layers) can reduce overfitting by randomly deactivating neurons, forcing the model to learn more robust features. Similarly, L2 weight decay penalizes large weights, encouraging simpler models that generalize better.
Data Augmentation
Transforming training images with random flips, rotations, and rescaling ensures that the model sees a diverse dataset, helping it learn invariant features. Data augmentation reduces reliance on memorization and enhances generalization.

### When to Stop Training
Training should have been stopped at Epoch 3, where validation accuracy peaked at 68.50%, and validation loss was at its lowest (0.6384). Subsequent epochs showed no meaningful improvement in validation accuracy and an increase in validation loss, signaling overtraining.

### Best and Worst Performing Classes
Best Performing Class: Snakes
•	Precision: 0.66
•	Recall: 0.95
•	F1-Score: 0.78
The model performed best on the snakes class, likely due to distinct visual features (e.g., elongated bodies, unique scales) that minimize overlap with other classes.
Worst Performing Class: Cats
•	Precision: 0.75
•	Recall: 0.42
•	F1-Score: 0.54
The cats class exhibited the lowest recall, indicating frequent misclassifications, likely due to visual similarities with dogs (e.g., fur patterns and facial features).

### Recommended Path for Improvement
1.	Class-Specific Augmentation
Aggressive augmentations, such as synthetic rotations or contrast adjustments, for cat images can help the model learn distinguishing features.
2.	Class Imbalance Correction
If cats are underrepresented in the dataset, oversampling or generating synthetic images for this class can balance training data distribution and improve recall.
3.	Feature Engineering
Fine-tuning the VGG16 model with adjusted learning rates or additional layers can emphasize class-specific features and reduce misclassification.

### Conclusion
This paper analyzed overtraining and model performance for image classification using VGG16. Overtraining was observed at Epoch 4, emphasizing the need for early stopping. Techniques such as regularization, data augmentation, and balanced datasets effectively mitigate overtraining and improve generalization. The snakes class performed best, while the cats class showed the worst. Recommendations for improving cat classification include targeted augmentation and balancing strategies.
